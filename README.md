# Altru

## Description

Altru is a charity application designed to connect strangers. It allows user to sign up as someone in need or someone willing to give. The hope of the app is to break down some of the walls created by a more disconnected culture and allow you to discover first hand what someone is going through.

## Technical

The program as written using Ruby on Rails. The database utilizes PostgreSQL.

## How To

The app is simple. Create an account and designate whether you wish to be a needer or a giver. If you are a giver the option to randomly connect will be on your home page.

## Future

I would like to add more user functionality so that someone in need can list actual items that they could use. That way a giver can choose to directly help in those regards. Also I would like needer's to provide more information about themselves so that someone willing to give can discover more information about them.
